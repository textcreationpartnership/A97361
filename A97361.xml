            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So the <hi>world</hi> twiÅ¿ts about many a godly man, and ChriÅ¿tianity dies within him: take heed we be not too buÅ¿ie with worldly affairs, that theychoak not all thoughts of better matters. There is a Å¿tory of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> the King asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had not obÅ¿erved the EclipÅ¿es: No, (Å¿aith he) I have Å¿o much to doe upon earth, that I have no leiÅ¿ure to looke up to heaven, A great many men have Å¿o much to doe upon earth, that they have no leiÅ¿ure to thinke of heaven, or any thing belonging to the Church of God, they have Å¿o much to doe in the puzzleing affaires of this life, and have Å¿uch a roule of them hanging one upon another; that when one hath done, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother comes and woes them; that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have time to thinke of Gods Church; to lay to heart their duty in that kind. Many men while heaven, and earth, are on fire about their eares; and the Church of God in ruine, and themÅ¿elues in danger, yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues are in the duÅ¿t, minding nothing but earth. As <hi>Archimides,</hi> the great Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7995:25"/> when the city was beÅ¿ieged, himÅ¿elf did more by his curious art, to hinder the taking of it, then all the reÅ¿t of the city could doe to defend it, and the Generall of the enemy, gave a Å¿peciall charge to preÅ¿erue <hi>Archimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> Now the city being able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t no longer was taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Archimides,</hi> hearing nothing all this while; the Å¿ouldiers broke into the houÅ¿e where he was, yet he takes no notice: nay they broke into the Å¿tudy where he was: and the Å¿oul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Å¿eeing him Å¿o buÅ¿ie, drawing his lines in the duÅ¿t, not once mooving, nor taking any notice of them, one of them Å¿eeing him not regard them, out of a Å¿cornefull nature thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him diÅ¿regarded drew his Å¿word, and run him through, and killed him, whoÅ¿e death the Generall of the enemy greatly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. Let us not bury our Å¿elves in the duÅ¿t of worldly thoughts, and Å¿uffer the Churches to periÅ¿h, but let us Å¿hake off this duÅ¿t from us, and mind our duty in regard of the Church of God, and contend with God for the welfare of it.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7995:26"/> not. It is that which <hi>becomes every one:</hi> and and it is the <hi>injunction of the Church,</hi> there is none that are baptized, but they are bound by their Å¿ureties, to be taught the creed, and the Lords Prayer, and the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and they doe not love their creed, that wil not offer vp their praiers for the Church: They that are of the Å¿ame faith, Å¿hould breath out the Å¿ame breath of prayer, and they doe not keepe the ten Commandements that doe not Å¿ay the Lords Prayer, that doe not offer vp their prayers for the Church of God: were wee of the Å¿ame faith, and heart with the Church of God, our affections, could not poÅ¿Å¿ibly, but breake out that way.</p>
                  <p>ObÅ¿erve the motive in the Text, <hi>They Å¿hall proÅ¿per that love thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let no man flatter himÅ¿elfe, they that <hi>pray not</hi> for the Church of God, <hi>love not</hi> the Church of God. Let them proÅ¿per that love thee, that is, that pray for thee, the one is the counter-pane of the other: if we doe not love it we will not pray for it, and if we do not pray for it we doe not love it. Yea if we pray not for the Church, <hi>wee looÅ¿e our Å¿hare in the prayers of the Church,</hi> you will Å¿ay that man hath a great eÅ¿tate that hath a part in every Å¿hip at Å¿ea, and yet to have an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all the prayers that are made to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are better then all the world: all the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7995:26"/> Churches praiers are for all the living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, the bleÅ¿Å¿ings will be to them, for a man to have a venture in every Å¿hip of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of all the churches throughout the world, I would not (for my part) leaue my Å¿hare in it, for all the world, and that man hath no Å¿hare in it, that will not afford a prayer for the Church, <hi>They Å¿hall proÅ¿per that love thee:</hi> Certainly, they Å¿hall proÅ¿per, they that doe love the Church, it Å¿hall goe well with them, and they Å¿hall proÅ¿per, and if they doe not, they Å¿hall not proÅ¿per. As <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Å¿aid to <hi>HeÅ¿ter,</hi> if thou doe not helpe, thou Å¿halt periÅ¿h, but the Church of God Å¿hall have deliverance. So the Church of God, Å¿hall in the end proÅ¿per, but they that pray not for the Church of God, Å¿hall not proÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but periÅ¿h.</p>
                  <p>In a word the cauÅ¿e is <hi>great,</hi> and we have <hi>great propriety in it,</hi> and it concernes us neerely, though we bee remote in place, and the Å¿ea part them and us.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>communion of the good;</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion <hi>of the evill</hi> of the Church, redounds to every particular member. And the <hi>times are Å¿uch,</hi> that a man would thinke they are times of prayer. Their enemies are as <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant</hi> as ever; and not onely Å¿o, but <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> and the Church of God all <hi>Millitant,</hi> in their warfare againÅ¿t their enemies; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour every way to their enemies; both
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7995:27"/> in <hi>armes,</hi> and <hi>counÅ¿ell,</hi> their minds are not Å¿o Å¿odered together: breaches are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t them which makes way for there ruine, and I know not what can ballance this but onely prayer. <hi>JoÅ¿hua</hi> though he bee the weakeÅ¿t; yet if <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> be a praying in the Mount, he may prevaile. There is nothing can counterpoize the odds that is betweene the Church of God, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it: nothing can make the ballance euen, and caÅ¿t the Å¿cale to the Church, but Prayer. And Å¿o much the more, becauÅ¿e <hi>God Å¿eemes to bee aÅ¿leepe</hi> in all their Å¿tormes, we Å¿hould Å¿ay therefore, as they to <hi>Jonah, AriÅ¿e and pray,</hi> wee Å¿hould goe and awaken every ChriÅ¿tian, to Prayer: that Å¿o wee may awaken God that Å¿eemes to Å¿leepe, and neglect, and let his Churches bee plunged in miÅ¿ery.</p>
                  <p>Againe we may bee invited with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ideration of the <hi>iÅ¿Å¿ue of it:</hi> the Å¿hip of the Church may bee Å¿till toÅ¿Å¿ed and tumbled, but becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t is in it, it can never periÅ¿h. The <hi>Romans</hi> loÅ¿t many a battell, and yet were conquerours in all their Warres. So it is with the Church of God: they have and may looÅ¿e many a battell, but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluÅ¿ion the Church will conquer, vnleÅ¿Å¿e man could wraÅ¿tle with God, and beat him out of heaven, they Å¿hall never overcome his Church, or his truth-upon earth. Now

                  <p>LaÅ¿tly, to cloÅ¿e all, doe but conÅ¿ider Å¿ome <hi>CircumÅ¿tances,</hi> in the bowels of the <hi>nature of prayer,</hi> to invite us to it.</p>
                  <p>It is almoÅ¿t, <hi>the onely thing left</hi> that we can doe for them, when we Å¿ee them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿ed round about with dangers, and there is no way to make an eÅ¿cape: Let us doe as <hi>Dedalus,</hi> that when he could not eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape by a way upon earth, went by a way of Heaven. Let us goe by the way of heaven, and that is by prayer, that is the onely way that is left, and it is Å¿o <hi>eaÅ¿ie a thing,</hi> and of <hi>Å¿o little coÅ¿t,</hi> that no man Å¿hould Å¿ticke at it, to give a Å¿ubÅ¿idie of prayers and Å¿ighes this way. Yea every man Å¿hould doe this in his private cloÅ¿et and family; Pray that God would looke upon his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to reÅ¿tore peace where it is not, and to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h it where it is, this is of Å¿o eaÅ¿ie a coÅ¿t, mee-thinkes no man Å¿hould Å¿ticke at it. As a Å¿tory hath it, there were a great many bookes of the Sybills, brought by a man to a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and hee prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to the King, at Å¿uch a rate, at a very great price, and the King would not give it: then the man burnt the one halfe of his bookes, and asked double the price that he did for the whole, the King refuÅ¿ed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7995:28"/> and he did the like with halfe of them, and doubled the price of all again, and then the King conÅ¿idering the value of them gave him the price. I am afraid, if wee forbeare to bid prayers for the peace of <hi>IeruÅ¿alem:</hi> the time may come wee may be content to bid blood, and our eÅ¿tates, and yet not doe them one halfe quarrel Å¿o much good as we may now by prayer.</p>
                  <p>Againe, conÅ¿ider what a <hi>Å¿oule blot it will bee,</hi> and what a brand it will Å¿et vpon vs, if we be defectiue in this kind. It is a <hi>perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> thing to betray the Church, and will leaue a great Å¿taine, and a Å¿hame vpon us for ever.

It is an obÅ¿ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one that wrote the HiÅ¿tory of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> relating what worthy acts many nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had done: the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did this valiant act, the <hi>Athenians</hi> did other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acts, and many other countries other worthy acts, and when it was demanded of him what his owne country-men of <hi>Cumin</hi> had done? he had nothing to Å¿ay of them, but that they had done juÅ¿t nothing.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:7995:28"/>
                  <p>ConÅ¿ider, that if when wee have heard that others have done Å¿o much for the Church: and that in the Story it Å¿hould bee Å¿aid, wee have done juÅ¿t nothing, wee have not Å¿o much as prayed throughly for them; what a Å¿taine would this bee: it will bee as great a Å¿taine, and brand to vs, and as little honour to be regiÅ¿tred in Stories if wee Å¿hould doe nothing in this kind as it is for <hi>Pilate</hi> to have his name written in the Creed.</p>

In the main of the Å¿tory, we may, both in regard of every PerÅ¿on and every family, and every State, and every Church, Å¿ee a mirrom of the courÅ¿e of honour, and the <hi>Å¿leppes by which it doth decline.</hi>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:7995:33"/>
                  <p>I onely note thus much out of this Å¿tory, in one thing.</p>
                  <p>Wee have here three generations recorded to us: <hi>Eli, Phinchas,</hi> and <hi>Ichabod. Eli,</hi> he begets <hi>Phinchas,</hi> and <hi>Phinchas</hi> he begets <hi>Ichabod.</hi> Now in <hi>Eli</hi> God taxeth <hi>remiÅ¿Å¿enÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> want of zeale: in <hi>Phinchas</hi> he taxeth <hi>prophaneneÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> want of conÅ¿cience: and <hi>Ichabod,</hi> (his very name boades no other.) <hi>The glory is departed from IÅ¿rael.</hi> The note then is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let but Zeale in a perÅ¿on, in a Family, in a Å¿tate or Church; once degenerate to luke-warmeneÅ¿Å¿e, and then luke-warmeneÅ¿Å¿e will Å¿oone beget prophanenes, and prophaneneÅ¿Å¿e will not be long before it doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, and bring us to ruine, that will bring in</hi> Ichabod, <hi>the glory is departed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Want of zeale is the firÅ¿t Å¿tep, from whence there is but one diÅ¿cent to ruine. This being thus briefly premiÅ¿ed, I Å¿hall now fall to the words of the Text.</p>
                  <p>And the text may Å¿eeme to bee a Charter of the Clergy, or a Kalender for all manner of dignity: or it is a perpetuall prognoÅ¿tication of the courÅ¿e of honour, though calculated for the Meridian of the high PrieÅ¿thood, yet Å¿uch as may Å¿erve (as thoÅ¿e men vÅ¿e to Å¿peake) for the generall latitude of all eminency, and may concerne all.</p>
                  <p>There bee but theÅ¿e 5. things: (though there might be many more) which I will take notice of, in the whole verÅ¿e. We have.</p>
